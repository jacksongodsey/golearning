# Welcome
This will be my repository for storing files as a learn GO.

## How to run go files

First you need to install GO. If you are on linux you will run `sudo {your package manager} {-whatever options} go`. If on Mac use homebrew, and run `brew install go`.

Next just navigate to the directory with the main.go file and either build or run the file. Runnning it will be slower but means you don't have to build the file. `go run {file.go}`. Building it will make a binary that you can run. `go build` Then just run the binary it produces. It will be an exe if you are on windows so you can just run that. On Mac and Linux it will just be a binary that you can run in the terminal by doing `./{yourbinary}`
