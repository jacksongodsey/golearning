# Welcome
This will be my repository for storing files as a learn GO.

## How to run go files

First you need to install GO.

- On Linux you will use your package manager:
  - `sudo {your package manager} {whatever options} go`
- On Mac you should use homebrew:
  - `brew install go`
- On Windows head to GO's website they should have a prebuilt binary for you.

Next you need to either run or build the project.

- To run the file you need to simply find the main file and input:
  - `go run {yourfile}`
  - Running the file doesn't build it so it is slower.
- To build the file you need to input:
  - `go build`
    - Make sure you are at the root directory of the project.
